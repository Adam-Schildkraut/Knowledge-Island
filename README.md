# Knowledge Island
Welcome to our repository for our Knowledge Island submissions. You can view how our code changed over the past few weeks, and what were the team's priorities and such. This readme will guide people who aren't familiar with the Github layout to see the progression of the code over time. If you're familiar with Github, then you don't really need to read this.

## Basic Navigation
You can click on the Our Work folder to see all the work we did on this. This is split up into three folders: the first two are our pair AI files. The third contains our testGame.c, Game.c, and runGame.c. You can then click on the file to view it in full with syntax highlighting.

## History
While looking at a file, you can hit Blame in the top-right to see who wrote which parts, along with the commit message for those parts. You can also hit History to view all the commits to that file. You can then click on the commit text to see what was changed in that push. You can also hit the <> on the right of that bit to browse the whole repo at the time of that commit to see the context.

If you're looking at a folder, the top-right has a picture of a clock, which also brings you to the history page for that whole folder.

## Graphs
On the right, you'll see a picture of a bar graph. You can click that to get some overall information about the project. You can then navigate to certain things through that.
