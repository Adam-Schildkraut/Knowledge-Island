# Knowledge Island
This is our repository for hosting everything about our project. We'll be able to see who edits what, what they did, and it'll automatically store all the changes if we want to quickly restore old files.

## Setup Instructions
Of course, you need to know how to use Github. Here's some very simple steps.
### 1. Download the Github client (if you're on Windows or Mac).
On Windows, you can get it from here: https://windows.github.com/
On Mac, you can get it from here: https://mac.github.com/
If you're on Linux, you can try learning how to use something called gitg. It's a similar graphical interface to use Git (although it's a lot more "traditional Git" rather than "specific to Github Git"). You can get it by typing this into your console: sudo apt-get install gitg
A lot of the terminology I'll be using is the same, but the directions may be different. You'll be able to do roughly the same things though.

### 2. Log in with your GitHub account.
Use your Github account to log in to the client. For Linux, this will come up during the next step.

### 3. Clone the repository.
On the Github client, you'll see this repository on the sidebar. What you want to do is "clone" it. You can put this anywhere you want. If you want to, you can pop it in a Dropbox folder so all of your devices can edit the code (but you still need to push it in some way).
On Linux, you'll find a way to clone, but you need a link to the repository. This is the one from the frontpage https://github.com/Biendeo/I-Am-Learning-To-Code.git.

And that's the setup. As for publishing your code, here's the process.
### 1. Sync (or pull and push) the repository.
The initial clone will "pull" the code from the repository. This means that you'll get all the files in the "master" branch. Pushing is the reverse, it sends the server all the "commits" you've made. On the Github client, both of these are merged into the "sync" button (and it should automatically tell you when you can do this).
On Linux, there should be a button that says "push" and a button that says "pull" somewhere. You may also see it next to a button called "fetch" (it's just like "pull" but it doesn't physically get the files, just the info about the changes).

### 2. Edit your code and commit.
When you've got the code, you can edit it all you want. No one can edit what is on your computer. When you're done editing, you need to "commit" your changes. The Github client will automatically note what files you've changed, and you can tick the ones you want to add to the commit. Then, type a little message saying what you changed. Then, confirm your commit. You can do this when you're offline too. When you hit "sync", it'll send your commits to this server, which will then share that with everyone else.
On Linux, you may need to look for a feature called "add", which will let you add the files you want to the repository. You may also go straight for the "commit" button, and it might automatically add any changed files to it. Remember to "push" after you commit.

### 3. Branched development
The best part about Github is that you can have multiple "branches" when working. This will allow all four of us to manage our own files on separate branches, and merge any changes we make to each other. We can use the "master" branch to host that "master" version of the file. To do this make a "new branch" (I think there's a button next to "sync" called "pull request", that's what you want).. You should name it after yourself, as it's best to only have one branch per person. There's a "merge" feature, but we'll figure that out later. For now, we should try to set up our branches.
On Linux, I have no clue how exactly to do this. You should find a "create branch" feature somewhere. Likewise, "merge" should be somewhere too. Look for that.

Hopefully with that, we'll get underway with this. Also, we're going to be splitting into two groups of two for making the AI. We might just stick with this repo. Keep it simple.

When the whole task is over, I'll make this repo public so you can share what you did to your OpenLearning blog.

## What should you commit
Everything. Notes, plans, pictures, anything really. If it's text, you can edit it. If it's pictures and stuff, you can view it. Make sure you commit everything you do, even if it seems silly. You'll always have a version on this repo to fall back on if anything messes up, and everyone in the group can constantly see what you do. Also, because it's all documented, it's really great to write about in your blog (with easy evidence things).
