# Roadmap
Put any stuff you want to plan in this bit here.

## Week 8
### testGame.c
[Task 1.0 (SUNDAY)](https://www.openlearning.com/courses/enhancedcomputing/Activities/TestgameC)

We need to:

	* ✗ Analyse what game.h does, and plan how to use its functions to make a game (we'll make this in functionPlan.md).
	* ✗ Actually write the game (write this to testGame.c).
	* ✗ Write a lot of test cases to see if everything works (using asserts).
	* ✗ End the tests with "All tests passed, you are Awesome!".

[Task 1.5 (SUNDAY)](https://www.openlearning.com/courses/enhancedcomputing/Activities/DesignTheStructGameInGameC)

We need to:

	* ✗ Analyse what game.h does, and plan what it will store.
	* ✗ Possibly implement _struct game in actual C code (make it defineStruct.h).

## Week 9

[Task 2.0 / Game.c (FRIDAY)](https://www.openlearning.com/courses/enhancedcomputing/Activities/GameC)

We need to:

	* ✗ Write the ADT version of the game using the planned functions and struct from last week.
	
[Task 2.1 / runGame() (FRIDAY)](https://www.openlearning.com/courses/enhancedcomputing/Activities/RungameFunction)

We need to:

	* ✗ Create a version of the game where the user types out commands (I guess we'll just type numbers and interpret those), and the game does its thing. This means that you could play the game like this. The AI won't be able to use this though.
	
[Task 2.2 / Mr Pass (SUNDAY)](https://www.openlearning.com/courses/enhancedcomputing/Activities/MrPass)

We need to:

	* ✗ Make a dumb AI that randomly decides a thing to do (but only passes a turn when that's the only thing he can do).

[Task 2.3 / Start the AI (FRIDAY)](https://www.openlearning.com/courses/enhancedcomputing/Activities/StartTheMechanicalTurk)

We need to:

 	* ✗ Play the game tonnes and find out ways to win. Google it too, we want the "pro strats" to winning this game.
	* ✗ Plan how to make the AI smarter. Figure out ways that it can calculate how to win. The better it can win, the better our AI will go.
