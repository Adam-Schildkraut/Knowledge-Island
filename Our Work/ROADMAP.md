# Roadmap
Put any stuff you want to plan in this bit here.

## Week 8
### testGame.c
[Task 1.0](https://www.openlearning.com/courses/enhancedcomputing/Activities/TestgameC)

We need to:

	* ✗ Analyse what game.h does, and plan how to use its functions to make a game (we'll make this in functionPlan.md).
	* ✗ Actually write the game (write this to testGame.c).
	* ✗ Write a lot of test cases to see if everything works (using asserts).
	* ✗ End the tests with "All tests passed, you are Awesome!".

[Task 1.5](https://www.openlearning.com/courses/enhancedcomputing/Activities/DesignTheStructGameInGameC)

We need to:

	* ✗ Analyse what game.h does, and plan what it will store.
	* ✗ Possibly implement _struct game in actual C code (make it defineStruct.h).

## Week 9

[Task 2.0 (No link)](https://www.openlearning.com/courses/enhancedcomputing/Schedule)

We need to:

	* ✗ *implement the Game logic by creating and implementing the methods of Game.c.  Note that the Game is to be an ADT (with interface given in Game.h).*
	
[Task 3.0 (No link)](https://www.openlearning.com/courses/enhancedcomputing/Schedule)

We need to:

	* ✗ *Pretend all the functions in Game.c have already been written (even if they haven't been finished yet). In your team of four, write in a file called runGame.c (which #includes Game.h) and contains a main function which lets you interactively step through a game, i.e. the user types in what action to perform rather than asking the player AIs which you will write later in a subsequent task. i.e. the runGame program should let you manually decide and input (using scanf) the move each player makes in turn, and the dice rolls, until the game is over.*
